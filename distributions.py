File containing various distribution functions for testing. These can
be imported and passed to the rate solver as desired. It should be
easy to add to this file. NOTE: All distribution functions must be
continuous! Yes, this is inconvenient, but (at the moment) the rate
calculations do not evaluate at predictable or specified values of E.
